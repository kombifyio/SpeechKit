# Changelog

All notable changes to SpeechKit should be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project is intended to ship under Apache-2.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Local whisper.cpp server startup: `Transcribe()` now blocks and waits for the server to finish loading instead of returning "not ready" immediately — hotkey presses during the first ~60 seconds after launch no longer silently fail

### Changed

- Fresh local installs now default to whisper.cpp (local-only routing) with HuggingFace disabled — users get an offline, zero-config experience out of the box without requiring a cloud token
- Added regression tests covering the startup-wait behavior: all three paths (success, failed startup, context cancellation) are now verified in CI on Windows with the race detector

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-11

### Changed

- Renamed the internal `ModalityAgent` modality to `ModalityAssist` across backend and frontend to match the three user-facing modes: Dictate, Assist, Voice Agent
- Replaced outdated catalog models: Qwen 2.5 7B/32B → Qwen 3.5 9B/27B, GPT-4o/GPT-4o mini → GPT-5.4/GPT-5.4 mini
- Removed "Utility" from user-visible model setup tabs — utility models remain internal but are no longer a selectable category in the UI
- Updated OpenAI provider defaults in config from gpt-4o-mini/gpt-4o to gpt-5.4-mini/gpt-5.4
- Frontend mode button and hotkey label renamed from "Agent" to "Assist"

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- Simplified model setup to a maximum of four visible options per mode, with direct inline API key entry or local download actions on each model card
- Removed stale Settings copy and dead Hugging Face credential helpers left behind by the provider UI redesign
- Improved Windows installer metadata so setup and uninstall surfaces present clearer product information during the interim unsigned release

### Changed

- Moved the public OSS release path to `kombifyio/SpeechKit`, with GitHub-hosted workflows and SignPath-ready Windows release wiring prepared for the next signed release
- Published the OSS code signing policy and public-repo operating model used for the upcoming SignPath Foundation onboarding

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Production readiness audit and hardening for multi-user test rollout
- Malformed `config.toml` now falls back to sane defaults instead of crashing on startup
- UI log notifications when AI providers or TTS audio player fail to initialize (degradation visibility)
- Test coverage for malformed config recovery path

### Changed

- Centralized data/config path resolution via `internal/runtimepath/` in store packages (SQLite, Postgres)
- Audit phases 1–6: real model names in catalog, crypto/rand usage, error leakage guards, MaxBytesReader on HTTP handlers, AppVersion via ldflags, downloads extraction to `internal/downloads/`, saveSettings decomposition, randHex error handling, overlay_position validation, CI coverage alignment

## [0.14.9] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Credential saves were silently failing — frontend was sending `secret` but the backend `saveProviderCredential` and `testProviderCredential` routes expect `credential`; corrected both URLSearchParams calls
- API Keys section in Settings → Providers was hidden when no keys were configured (filtered by `available: true`); changed to show all providers unconditionally
- TypeScript TS2538 error: `executionMode` is optional on `ModelProfile`; guarded before using it as a `PROVIDER_FOR_EXECUTION_MODE` index

### Changed

- Settings → Providers tab restructured: Models section now appears first, API Keys section below (was reversed)
- Each model profile row shows an inline amber cue ("API key required — configure below ↓") when the required provider key is missing
- Added **Test** button to each API key row to validate a key before saving

## [0.14.8] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Generic provider credential UI — users can now save, clear, and test API keys per provider (HuggingFace, OpenAI, Google, Groq) directly in Settings → Providers

### Fixed

- Replaced GitHub App auth in the OSS publish workflow with a direct `OSS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` PAT to eliminate intermittent token issuance failures
- Removed the unused `providerCredentialProvider` helper that was blocking staticcheck
- Updated releaseguard test to reflect the new OSS publish auth mechanism

## [0.14.7] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Restored the OSS publish auth fallback so cross-repo source mirroring and release creation keep working without mandatory GitHub App credentials
- Made OSS tag sync idempotent and exported the Windows runtime preparation scripts so public `kombifyio/SpeechKit` tags can build Windows release artifacts again

## [0.14.6] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Switched the OSS mirror workflow to dedicated `OSS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` HTTPS auth via `GIT_ASKPASS`, avoiding the failing inline credential path on the CI runner
- Updated OpenTelemetry dependencies to `v1.40.0` so `govulncheck` no longer blocks CI on the current release line
- Removed the zero-duration timing assumption from the STT HTTP provider tests so Windows release builds no longer fail on fast local test servers

## [0.14.5] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Switched the Windows build script to call `npm.cmd` directly so GitHub Actions no longer routes frontend steps through the broken PowerShell wrapper path
- Moved CI and release workflows to Go `1.25.9` and updated `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` to `v5.17.1` to clear the current `govulncheck` failures
- Normalized the OSS publish token before git access and removed the stale duplicate release block that would have broken the release workflow after a successful build

## [0.14.4] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Switched Windows build entry points to `pwsh` so CI and tag builds no longer fall back to Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Switched OSS mirroring to explicit git-over-HTTPS token auth instead of relying on the checkout action's failing cross-repo auth path
- Cleared the current CI blockers in Staticcheck and Android lint for the `main` release path

## [0.14.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Replaced the strict-mode-unsafe PowerShell release build invocation so tagged Windows releases can build again
- Hardened the OSS publish flow to validate mirror token access before checkout and reuse the same token source across mirror checkout and release upload

### Changed

- Bumped release identifiers across desktop, Android, installer metadata, and frontend artifacts to 0.14.3

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Made the release workflow build from the requested Git tag during manual dispatch so published installers match the tagged source
- Fixed the OSS publish workflow to use workspace-safe checkout paths, remove the legacy `.public-export-v8` gitlink blocker, and mirror installer assets into the public `kombifyio/SpeechKit` release

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Self-contained Windows release packaging that bundles `whisper-server`, required runtime DLLs, and the `ggml-small.bin` local model for installer and portable distributions
- Changesets-based versioning workflow for future release PRs

### Changed

- Switched the canonical Windows install layout to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\SpeechKit` so the installer, bundled local runtime, and default config paths resolve consistently
- Updated shipped defaults and first-run local install behavior to prefer the bundled local runtime with dynamic routing
- Bumped release identifiers across desktop, Android, installer metadata, and frontend artifacts to 0.14.0

### Fixed

- Hardened Android release readiness around assistant wiring, secure token storage, deep links, onboarding checks, and CI coverage
- Replaced placeholder quick-note summary and email actions in the Windows host with working backend handlers

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Removed deprecated `oto` player Close call (staticcheck SA1019)
- Removed unused `hideAssistBubble` method (staticcheck U1000)

### Changed

- Bumped version identifiers across all platforms to 0.1.3

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30
