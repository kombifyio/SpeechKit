# Changelog

All notable changes to SpeechKit should be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project is intended to ship under Apache-2.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Made the release workflow build from the requested Git tag during manual dispatch so published installers match the tagged source
- Fixed the OSS publish workflow to use workspace-safe checkout paths, remove the legacy `.public-export-v8` gitlink blocker, and mirror installer assets into the public `kombifyio/SpeechKit` release

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Self-contained Windows release packaging that bundles `whisper-server`, required runtime DLLs, and the `ggml-small.bin` local model for installer and portable distributions
- Changesets-based versioning workflow for future release PRs

### Changed

- Switched the canonical Windows install layout to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\SpeechKit` so the installer, bundled local runtime, and default config paths resolve consistently
- Updated shipped defaults and first-run local install behavior to prefer the bundled local runtime with dynamic routing
- Bumped release identifiers across desktop, Android, installer metadata, and frontend artifacts to 0.14.0

### Fixed

- Hardened Android release readiness around assistant wiring, secure token storage, deep links, onboarding checks, and CI coverage
- Replaced placeholder quick-note summary and email actions in the Windows host with working backend handlers

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Removed deprecated `oto` player Close call (staticcheck SA1019)
- Removed unused `hideAssistBubble` method (staticcheck U1000)

### Changed

- Bumped version identifiers across all platforms to 0.1.3

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Framework core** (`pkg/speechkit/`): interface-driven orchestration for recording, transcription, and output delivery — usable as a standalone Go library
- **Three operating modes**: Dictation (STT only), Assist (STT + LLM + TTS), Voice Agent (real-time audio-to-audio)
- **Six STT providers**: local whisper.cpp, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Groq, Google Cloud Speech, self-hosted VPS
- **TTS providers**: OpenAI TTS, Google Cloud TTS, local Kokoro
- **LLM integration** via Firebase Genkit with multi-provider support (Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, Ollama, Hugging Face)

- **Settings UI** for provider, overlay, hotkey, and storage preferences
- **Local SQLite storage** for transcription history with optional PostgreSQL backend
- **Provider-agnostic credential model**: tokenless framework core, host-managed secret storage via Windows Credential Manager

- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions (frontend tests, Go analysis, Windows build, automated releases)
- **Library usage example** (`examples/library/`) demonstrating framework integration without UI
- **First-run onboarding wizard** with microphone selection, hotkey configuration, and quick start guide
- **Error toast notifications** surfacing provider errors as user-visible messages
